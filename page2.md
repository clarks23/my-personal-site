# Information Technology

Like I mentioned before I am currently majoring In **IT**. I like **IT** becuase it is a broad feild of study, and right now I'm experiencing multiple career paths in **IT**, such as, Digital media and software engineering. 

Here is a block of *code* from a previous *project* I've done in **IT**

```import turtle

star = turtle.Turtle()

# Set up the initial position and orientation of the turtle
star.penup()
star.goto(0, 0)
star.pendown()

# Define the size of the star
size = 100

# Draw the star
for i in range(5):
    star.forward(size)
    star.right(144)
    star.forward(size)
    star.left(72)
    
# Keep the window open until it is manually closed
turtle.done()```
